# iptables-gcli
When even `ufw` seems too bloated, `iptables-gcli` is an `iptables` wrapper which aims to make it easy to add, edit and reorder iptables rules by adding a graphical user-interface to `iptables`. The app never attempts to manage any iptables rules for you, but rather provides an interface for managing such rules.
